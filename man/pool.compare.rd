\title{Compare two nested models fitted to imputed data}

\description{
  Compares two nested models after m repeated complete data analysis
}

\usage{
  pool.compare(fit1, fit0, data=NULL, method="Wald")
}

\arguments{
  \item{fit1}{An object of class 'mira', produced by \code{with.mids()}.}
  \item{fit0}{An object of class 'mira', produced by \code{with.mids()}. The model in \code{fit0} 
    should be a submodel of \code{fit1}. Moreover, the variables of the submodel
    should be the first variables of the larger model and in the same order as in the submodel.}
  \item{data}{In case of method "likelihood" it is necessary to pass also the original \code{mids} 
  object to the \code{data} argument. Default value is \code{NULL}, in case of method="Wald".}
  \item{method}{A string describing the method to compare the two models. 
    Two kind of comparisons are included so far: "Wald" and "likelihood".}
}   

\value{
  A list containing the elements:
  \item{call}{The call to the \code{pool.compare} function}
  \item{call11}{The call that created \code{fit1}}
  \item{call12}{The call that created the imputations.}
  \item{call01}{The call that created \code{fit0}}
  \item{call02}{The call that created the imputations.}
  \item{method}{The method used to compare two models: "Wald" or "likelihood"}
  \item{nmis}{The number of missing entries for each variable.}
  \item{m}{The number of imputations}
  \item{qhat1}{A matrix, containing the estimated coeffients of the \emph{m} repeated complete data analyses from \code{fit1}}
  \item{qhat0}{A matrix, containing the estimated coeffients of the \emph{m} repeated complete data analyses from \code{fit0}}
  \item{ubar1}{The mean of the variances of object1, formula (3.1.3), Rubin (1987).}
  \item{ubar0}{The mean of the variances of object0, formula (3.1.3), Rubin (1987).}
  \item{qbar1}{The pooled estimate of object1, formula (3.1.2) Rubin (1987).}
  \item{qbar0}{The pooled estimate of object0, formula (3.1.2) Rubin (1987).}
  \item{Dm}{The test statistic}
  \item{rm}{Relative increase in variance due to nonresponse, formula (3.1.7), Rubin (1987).}
  \item{df1}{df1; Under the null hypothesis it is assumed that Dm has an F distribution with (df1,df2) degrees of freedom.}
  \item{df2}{df2}
  \item{pvalue}{P-value of testing whether the larger model is statistically different from the smaller submodel.}

\details{
  The function is based on the article of Meng and Rubin (1992). The Wald-method can be
  found in paragraph 2.2 and the likelihoodmethod can be found in paragraph 3.
  One could use the Wald method for comparison of linear models obtained with e.g. \code{lm} (in \code{with.mids()}).
  The likelihood method should be used in case of logistic regression models obtaind with \code{glm()} in 
  \code{with.mids()}.
  It is assumed that fit1 contains the larger model and the model in \code{fit0} is fully contained in \code{fit1}. 
  In case of \code{method="Wald"}, the null hypothesis is tested that the extra parameters are all zero.

### To compare two linear models:
imp <- mice(nhanes2)
mi1 <- with(data=imp, expr=lm(bmi~age+hyp+chl))
mi0 <- with(data=imp, expr=lm(bmi~age+hyp))
pc  <- pool.compare(mi1, mi0, method="Wald")
pc$spvalue
#            [,1]
#[1,] 0.000293631
# 

### Comparison of two general linear models (logistic regression).
imp  <- mice(boys, maxit=2)
\donttest{
fit0 <- with(imp, glm(gen>levels(gen)[1] ~ hgt+hc,family=binomial))
fit1 <- with(imp, glm(gen>levels(gen)[1] ~ hgt+hc+reg,family=binomial))
pool.compare(fit1, fit0, method="likelihood", data=imp)}
