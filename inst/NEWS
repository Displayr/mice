MICE: Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations

MICE is an R package implementing multiple imputation of
incomplete multivariate data according the principle of
Fully Conditional Specification (FCS).


The current version is MICE V2.5, which is described in

  Van Buuren S, Groothuis-Oudshoorn K (2010).
  MICE: Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations in R.
  Journal of Statistical Software, forthcoming.

FIXED:   Stricter type checking on logicals in mice() to evade warnings.
CHANGED: Modernization of all help files.
FIXED:   padModel: treatment changed to contr.treatment
CHANGED: Functions check.visitSequence, check.predictorMatrix, check.imputationMethod are now coded as local to mice()
FIXED:   existsFunction in check.imputationMethod now works both under S-Plus and R

v1.16 - 6/25/2007

FIXED: The impution function impute.logreg used convergence criteria that were too optimistic when fitting a GLM with glm.fit. Thanks to Ulrike Gromping.

v1.15 - 01/09/2006

FIXED: In the lm.mids and glm.mids functions, parameters were not passed through to glm and lm.

v1.14R - 9/26/2005 11:44AM
FIXED: Passive imputation works again. (Roel de Jong)
CHANGED: Random seed is now left alone, UNLESS the argument "seed" is specified. This means that unless you
specify identical seed values, imputations of the same dataset will be different for multiple calls to mice. (Roel de Jong)

FIXED: Function 'summary.mids' now works (Roel de Jong)
FIXED: Imputation function 'impute.polyreg' and 'impute.lda' should now work under R
