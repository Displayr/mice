CHANGELOG MICE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

v1.14R - 9/26/2005 11:44AM

Release Notes & known issues: 
* Although MICE will remain compatible with S-PLUS, because of its superior memory management we encourage the use of R for multiple imputation with MICE.
* Imputation functions 'impute.norm.improper' and 'impute.logreg2' are disabled.

FIXED: Passive imputation works again. (Roel de Jong)
CHANGED: Random seed is now left alone, UNLESS the argument "seed" is specified. This means that unless you specify identical seed values, imputations of the same dataset will be different for multiple calls to mice. (Roel de Jong) 
FIXED (docs): Documentation for "impute.mean" (Roel de Jong)
FIXED: Function 'summary.mids' now works (Roel de Jong)
FIXED: Imputation function 'impute.polyreg' and 'impute.lda' should now work under R
